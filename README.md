Assignment 02: Create a Personal Website

OVERVIEW:
The purpose of this website is to create a personal website for myself to use in storing my assignments and other works produced within the course (IAT355: Introduction to Visual Analytics). The goal is to build this website to include information such as my skills, educational background, experiences, and personal interests. This website also serves as practice and to allow myself to gain more experience in front-end web development (using HTML and CSS) and version control using GitHub.

TECHNOLOGIES:
This website was created using GitHub and Visual Studio code for coding using HTML and CSS.

NAVIGATION:
The website has two pages:

01. Home
    This page contains information such as an introduction to who I am and what I do.   Other content includes educational background, technical skills, experiences, contact information, and previous projects from my courses.

02. Visualizations
    This page contains visualizations of SVG arts that I have created for this assignment.
